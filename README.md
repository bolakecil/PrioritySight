# PrioritySight

## Introduction
PrioritySight is a cutting-edge web-based service designed to assist medical workers in effectively assessing medical emergencies. Integrating with Brazil's United Health System, it employs the ADULT Triage system to accurately classify patients in emergency care units into three categories: Low, Medium, and High priority. This classification is crucial for prompt and efficient patient care in critical situations.

## Objective
The primary goal of PrioritySight is to provide a reliable and user-friendly tool for medical professionals to prioritize patient care based on the severity of their condition. Utilizing advanced algorithms and a seamless interface, it ensures quick and accurate triage assessments, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and more efficient emergency room operations.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend Development**: The user interface is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, offering a responsive and intuitive experience for the users.
- **Backend Development**: The core of PrioritySight is powered by Python. The fuzzy algorithm for triage classification is implemented using libraries such as scikit-fuzzy, numpy, and matplotlib.
- **Web Framework**: Flask is used as the web framework to facilitate Python execution and seamless integration between the frontend and backend components.

## Features
- **Triage Classification**: Patients are classified into Low, Medium, or High priority categories, based on the severity of their conditions.
- **Fuzzy Algorithm**: The use of a fuzzy logic algorithm allows for nuanced and accurate patient assessment, taking into account various health indicators and symptoms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: The web interface is designed for ease of use, enabling medical professionals to quickly input data and receive triage recommendations.
